# CDK and Wireguard
This repo will create a Wireguard host EC2 node using CDK

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
 `cdk.json` needs to have your AWS ID added.  `cdk.json` is set to .gitignore to guard against accidentally checking the file in.

See the `./bin` directory for useful commands
